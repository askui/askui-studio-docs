# Trigger Workflows from Your CI Pipeline
At the moment, AskUI supports three CI pipeline integrations: Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and Gitlab CI. Each of these integrations provides an efficient way to automate the building, testing, and deployment of your application.

[Azure DevOps](../03-All-Integrations/01-azure-devops.md)

Azure DevOps is a comprehensive platform that provides various tools for project management, version control, and CI/CD. It offers a wide range of features such as agile project management, Git repositories, and continuous delivery, enabling users to build, test, and deploy their applications with ease.

[GitHub Actions](../03-All-Integrations/02-github-actions.md)

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that enables users to automate their workflows directly from their GitHub repositories. It provides a wide range of features such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and event-driven workflows. GitHub Actions also offers a marketplace where users can discover and use various actions to build, test, and deploy their applications.

[Gitlab CI](../03-All-Integrations/03-gitlab-ci.md)

Gitlab CI is a popular CI/CD platform that provides an integrated DevOps toolchain for building, testing, and deploying applications. It enables users to automate their workflows and provides an intuitive interface for managing projects, repositories, and pipelines. Gitlab CI also provides a wide range of features such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and code quality analysis.

At AskUI, we understand the importance of automation and efficiency in the software development process. That's why we support these three CI pipeline integrations, enabling our users to build, test, and deploy their applications with ease and speed.
