# Learn the Basics of AI Automation
**AI Automation** refers to the process of using artificial intelligence (AI) to create and control processes with minimal human intervention. This includes a variety of tasks and processes across different company divisions. The primary aim is to increase efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of operations.

Key aspects include:

1. **Efficiency:** Processes vast amounts of data quickly.
2. **Adaptability:** Learns and evolves from data, rather than just following set instructions.
3. **Versatility:** Applicable across many domains, from manufacturing to customer service.
4. **Error Reduction:** Minimizes human mistakes in operations.
5. **Economic Impact:** Boosts productivity but raises concerns about job displacement.
6. **Implementation:** Often complex and might require overhauling existing systems.

AskUI allows users to fully control their devices with the help of visual selectors

### Strengths

* Automate apps without APIs
* Full control over the operating system
* Robust visual selectors

### Limitations

* Can make mistakes at first
* Requires some knowledge of prompting

### Use cases

* Document processing
* Software testing
* Marketing automation

## Take control
To prompt an AI to do something, you need to give it some instructions. Once you ‚Äúrun‚Äù a workflow, an AI runner will carry out its contents, depending on what it sees on screen at that moment.

AI runners work on the highest layer of interaction - the same as humans. When hosted locally or in the cloud, they live on the operating system and control the mouse and keyboard to interact with their environment

A workflow is a sequence of steps, that lead the AI to the completion of a task that contains information about the intended action, which can include a description of an element that you want to perform the action on.

- Action - describe what the runner should do.
- Elements - describe what the runner should perform the action on.
- Relations - specify the element‚Äôs location further.

Example instructions:

* üëà Type in textfield left of button ‚ÄúSign Up‚Äù
* üëÅÔ∏è Click on image matching ‚Äúred nike shoes with purple laces‚Äù
* üßÆ Get table containing text ‚ÄúSales targets‚Äù

## Empathize
It might seem strange to mention empathy when talking about a statistical model. Yet this paradigm has proven to be extremely useful when using AI for the purpose of automating human-centered tasks.

It is all about providing clear instructions!

For some users, this comes easy, while for others, it‚Äôs a long journey of relearning concepts. In any case, we‚Äôre here to help you along the way.

## Run it
Workflows can be triggered in two ways:

- Event-based through a webhook
- Time-based through a schedule

‚ö° **Event-based triggers** execute workflows remotely, when an outside event occurs through a webhook.
üïí **Time-based triggers** run in regular intervals from 5 minutes to every year. This feature is only

We provide support for a range of popular automation platforms, reporting solutions and data sources, environments that you can use to incorporate AskUI into your ecosystem

We are constantly adding more integrations and even allowing you to build your own custom integrations.
